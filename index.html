        <h1>I will tell you what is Syria</h1>
        <p>Syria is the place presented the first alphabet in the history. 
            Syria is the source of the musical notes that have spread in the world. 
            Marhaba is our hello word which has been used by ancient syrian christians, and it means Godlove. 
            The original language of the syrians is Syriac which is Jesus Christ's mother tongue, peace be upon him. 
            Damascus is the oldest inhabited capital city, and Aleppo is the oldest city in the world. 
            Syria is home to 11 different civilizations in the world. And most important inventors, geniuses and poets 
            are syrians like Steve Jobs, Nizar Qabbani, the astronaut Muhammad Faris, and the discover of the blood circulation 
            Ibn al-Nafis. Syria has never been a burden to anyone or to any country, and has always been self-sufficient 
            and exports the best and the finest goods such as silk, textile and fabric, and even vegetables and oils. 
            Eighty percent of its people have their own private homes before the crisis. Syria welcomes Lebanese, Palestinian, Iraqi, 
            Arnauts, Circassian, Armenians, Kurds, Turkmen, and even the peaceful Jews. WE DID NOT build a tent for them. 
            This is Syria.
